# City Jail Database Project

## How to install

You can use VSCode, PyCharm, or whatever editor/IDE you want to use.

1. First clone the git repository
```
git clone https://github.com/awu0/City-Jail-Database-Project.git
```

2. Go into the folder that has `requirements.txt`
3. It is recommended to create a virtual environment. Look at the [official documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html) or just Google it
4. Start the virtual environment and install the requirements needed to run the app
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

***Make sure the virtual environment is running before starting the app.***

## Django
A brief tutorial on Django can be found [here](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/5.0/intro/tutorial01/).
We are using Django because it is easier to use than Flask (what the professor introduced in class).
